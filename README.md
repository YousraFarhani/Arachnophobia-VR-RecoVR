# Arachnophobia-VR-RecoVR
  RecoVR or Recover is a VR-based mobile application built with XR-toolkit in Unity for people suffering from mental health issues such as stress and anxiety disorder, many kinds of phobias and fears like spiders(Arachnophobia), clowns(Coulrophobia), flying, snakes, and public speaking,â€¦ It helps them face their fears in a virtual world. It also helps them to meditate and relax in a calming environment just by wearing the VR headsets, and it also allows them to do their favorite activities that might cost them a lot of money in real life, like visiting their favorite places, going out for shopping, or just hanging out with friends who are using the app. All of that is just to help them recover and heal their mental health by relaxing, doing what they love, experiencing their fears, and being prepared for real-life situations.
